## Welcome to my Github Profile ðŸ˜Š

I would like to show you a small overview of my development projects here. Unfortunately, I cannot make all projects public, as some of the applications are developments for my employer. Nevertheless, you can read about at least some of the work I have developed over the last few years. My private projects are of course public.<br><br>
First of all, a little about myself. My real name is Marc and I currently work for Constantin Film in Munich. I completed my training as a web developer many years ago. I have gained a lot of experience in the field of web development and was able to expand my basic knowledge of HTML, CSS, Javascript and PHP/MySQL. At that time, there were no sophisticated frameworks or runtime libraries. In recent years, I have worked intensively with SPAs/PWAs as well as frameworks (such as React and Angular) and was able to acquire expertise in working with Rest APIs.<br><br>
Thanks to my employer, I also had the opportunity to acquire a lot of knowledge about various Microsoft products (such as Powerapps, Power Automate, Dataverse, Sharepoint, Onedrive, Azure, Entra, etc.).
<br><br>
Essentially, I created Powerapps for Microsoft Teams, which worked with Dataverse and Power Automate Cloud Flows. Most of the work involved planning and creating the canvas apps, designing the database structures for Dataverse and interface programming using Power Automate Cloud Flows.
<br><br>
But enough about me now. Here is the overview of current projects<br>



> [!IMPORTANT]
> There is one more thing I would like to mention. Since I'm in the process of completely revamping my Github profile, my repos are currently not publicly available (sorry for that. I hope you can understand). The repos will gradually be accessible again as soon as I updated my profile

### ðŸ“Œ AngularDevBox
I work a lot with Angular, NodeJS (NPM), Typescript and HTML/SCSS these days. The AngularDevBox was actually just a kind of "playground" for myself. I tried out a lot of things here when I was learning the Angular framework. Accordingly, the code is also quite extensively documented and explained. In the end, I liked my own AngularDexBox so much that I thought about making a small "Angular Starter Project" for beginners to the Angular Framework. And this is the AngularDevBox.
<br><br>
I am currently in the process of revising this repo and changing a few things. The repo should be equipped with a tutorial for the AngularDevBox, so that you can build the AngularDevBox yourself. The AngularDevBox will also be revised and updated a little.
### ðŸ“Œ AngularCLI Generator
This is actually just a by-product of when I taught myself the Angular Framework. At some point during the learning phase, there was a point where I didn't feel like constantly reading up in the online references which command I needed for the Angular CLI to do this and that. So I started to create an Angular project that allows me to generate Angular CLI commands for a wide variety of scenarios. The app is also able to generate entire Powershell scripts with which you can easily and automatically create and set up an entire Angular project (with NPM modules, Angular components, Angular services and much more).<br><br>
The AngularCLI Generator simplifies working with the Angular CLI and makes creating new Angular projects a lot easier. Instead of typing long lines of code into the console, a few clicks here and there are all it takes to create and set up an entire project.
### ðŸ“Œ NoX (a.k.a. NoX Box)
The NoX Box is a Rest API backend server based on NodeJS/ExpressJS. It started when I wanted to implement an E-Mail Service in an App, but couldn't find a good and practical solution. So I started to create a solution for myself that would allow me to send E-Mails via a Google Account. While working on the NoX Box, I realized that I can use this Rest API Backend Server for other things as well. And that is now the NoX project. I will work on this here from time to time and extend the Backend Rest API accordingly. The plan is to make NoX a CRUD Rest API Backend, with which you will not only be able to send emails via Google, but also access SQL databases and perform CRUD actions (Create, Read, Update, Delete). I'm also planning to extend  NoX with some features to secure the server against attacks and make it more safe to use. Due to I am not an Security Expert, this may take some time.
### ðŸ“Œ StaffManager-v2
StaffManager is a Canvas App for Microsoft Teams and serves as an interface between HR and IT. Employees can be reported for onboarding or offboarding and personnel changes such as job changes or special leave can be submitted. The Canvas App works with Dataverse to manage the data and uses Power Automate Cloud Flow to send requests by email. The StaffManaer also uses a Rest API to create and update tickets in a ticket management system.
### ðŸ“Œ CihpKeyAllocator
This is also a Canvas App for Microsoft Teams. ChipKeyAllocator is a supplement to StaffManager. When new staff are hired or an employee leaves the company, the StaffManager generates a database entry for the ChipKeyAllocator. With the ChipKeyAllocator, the Facility department is able to manage access chips and keys for employees. The Canvas App also uses Dataverse to access and manage the StaffManager data. Power Automate Cloud Flows is also used here to generate and send emails. The ChipKeyAllocator also uses the same Rest API to update the corresponding tickets in the ticket management system. StaffManager and ChipKeyAllocator use shared resources to manage and process data collaboratively and across departments.
### ðŸ“Œ SUMO Projekt Manager
This app is a kind of project manager for the Department of Film Music. The SUMO Project Manager is again a Canvas App for Microsoft Teams. The big difference to the other Canvas Apps is that the SUMO Project Manager has its own area in Sharepoint, which it manages completely. Colleagues can use the app to manage their projects, create folders, manage their content and upload and download files. It is also possible to use forms to create and manage project data in a Dataverse database.

I hope you enjoyed my little project list and maybe there were some interesting things for you. Of course, it's just a small list of projects I'm currently working on or have recently completed. There are a few more projects in my repo.<br><br><br>
